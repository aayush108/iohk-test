Metadata API Test
========================

This is an automated test project for Metadata API. The project is created in java using REST Assured library.

### How to run

To run the automated tests, type from command line:

```
mvn test
```
To generate allure reports use the following command from the project directory

```
mvn allure:serve
```

### Issues found:

I was not able to run the project locally. All the tests that I have written are based on the server instance. 
I've tried focus more on the framework than the test suite.
